## LOGISTIC REGRESSION WITH PCA:
***
* tensorflow
* numpy 
* panda
* matplotlib
* keras
* sklearn
* matplotlib

## USAGE:
*** 
* LOGISTIC_REGRESSION_WITH_PCA folder contains PCA.py, PCA_2.ipynb, PCA_10.ipynb, LOGISTIC_REGRESSION_WITH_PCA.ipynb and mnist folder which contains mnist dataset required for PCA_2.ipynb and PCA_10.ipynb  file.
* Execute the each cell of  PCA_2.ipynb notebook file to generate output for 2 PC in Jupyter Notebook.
* Execute the each cell of  PCA_10.ipynb notebook file to generate output for 10 PC in Jupyter Notebook.
* Execute the each cell of  LOGISTIC_REGRESSION_WITH_PCA.ipynb file to generate output for classifier with PC in Jupyter Notebook.
* mnist folder and PCA.py should be on same folder with corresponding notebook file to run it.
