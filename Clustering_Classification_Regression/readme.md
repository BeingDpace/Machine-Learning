# MACHINE LEARNING
***
***
* coding is done on Python 3.8.5
***

## Clustering, Classification, And Regression:
***
* math
* operator
* numpy 
* panda
* matplotlib
* linalg from scipy

## USAGE:
***
### Clustering:
* K_Means folder contains kmean.py and kmeans_main.ipynp file.
* Execute the each cell of  kmeans_main notebook file to generate output.
* Both file should be on same folder to run the notebook file 

### Classification AND Regression:
* Knn_classification_and_regression folder contains knnclassification.py, knnregression.py, and myLWR.py (contains code for implementation of respective algorithm)
* It also includes knnclassification_main.ipynb, knnregression_main.ipynb, and myLWR_main.ipynb file which can be executed using Jupyter Notebook.
* .py file of corresponding .ipynb file should be on same folder to run the notebook file





```python
