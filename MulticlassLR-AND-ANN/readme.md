## MULTICLASS LOGISTIC REGRESSION AND ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK:
***
* numpy 
* panda
* matplotlib
* keras

## USAGE:
***
### MULTICLASS LOGISTIC REGRESSION:
* Multiclass_LR folder contains multiclass_logistic_regression.py and multiclass_logistic_regression.ipynb file.
* Execute the each cell of  logistic_regression.ipynb notebook file to generate output in Jupyter Notebook.
* .py file of corresponding .ipynb file should be on same folder to run the notebook file

### ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK:
* ANN folder contains ANN.ipynb file, Just execute each line in Google Colab to generate output.
